# Validation: HIP depth maps vs the CUDA node

## Method
Same photos, same SfM, same DepthMap parameters; only the GPU stage differs.

1. Photos: [alicevision/dataset_monstree](https://github.com/alicevision/dataset_monstree)
   (`mini6` = 6 images, `full` = 41 images), copied to `house-pc:/data/scans/monstree-*`.
2. CUDA reference: Meshroom 2023.3.0 `meshroom_batch` on house-pc (GTX 1080 Ti, CUDA 11.3)
   with `FeatureExtraction:describerTypes=sift FeatureExtraction:forceCpuExtraction=False
   DepthMap:downscale=2` (the node's `standard` preset). The whole cache through
   `DepthMapFilter` is copied to `data/ref/<dataset>/` (tar over ssh).
3. HIP run: `scripts\run-depthmap.cmd <dataset>` feeds the reference `sfm.abc` and
   `PrepareDenseScene` images to the Windows/HIP `aliceVision_depthMapEstimation` with the
   exact command line Meshroom recorded in `DepthMap/*/0.status`, then runs
   `scripts/compare_depthmaps.py` (per-view valid-mask agreement, relative depth error
   distribution, simMap MAD, side-by-side PNGs).

Pass criterion (initial): >= 98 % of jointly-valid pixels within 1 % relative depth and
>= 95 % valid-mask agreement per view. The algorithms are deterministic, so differences
should come only from fast-math / FMA contraction and texture-filter precision.

```

Valid masks identical, median relative depth error 0, p95 about 0.1 %, 98-99 % of pixels
within 1 %. The residual 1-2 % of pixels off by more than 1 % and the simMap MAD are
consistent with two different AliceVision versions (Meshroom 2023.3 = AliceVision 3.1 on the
node vs the 2026 development tree here) plus FMA/texture-filter differences; a same-version
CUDA reference would tighten this, and the 41-image set will show whether it holds at scale.

What it took to get from "runs" to "PASS": the first HIP run produced all-invalid maps
because **HIP on Windows samples half4 (16-bit float) texture arrays as zeros**
(`hip/tests/half_tex.hip` isolates it; float4 arrays are fine). AliceVision's camera
mipmaps use half4 by default; the HIP build now selects the float4 path (2x camera-image
VRAM). Revisit when ROCm fixes half textures on Windows, or when profiling shows texture
bandwidth matters.

### monstree-full (41 views), 2026-09-03 - strict criterion FAIL, agreement otherwise excellent

Full per-view table, CSV/JSON and downscaled best/median/worst panels:
[docs/validation/monstree-full/index.md](validation/monstree-full/index.md)
(mini6: [docs/validation/monstree-mini6/index.md](validation/monstree-mini6/index.md)).

* mask agreement >= 95 % on 41/41 views (40 of them exactly 1.000; view 1227295871 at 0.971)
* per-view **median** relative depth error is 0.0000 on all 41 views
* fraction within 1 %: median over views 0.988; 34 views >= 0.97; worst view 0.917 (1430763847),
  then 0.925 (528863451) and 0.928 (1317225462); largest per-view p95 = 7.1 %
* wall time 154.7 s on the RX 9070 vs 105.5 s on the 1080 Ti (mini6 was 21 s vs 32 s); the
  41-view run is not yet profiled - float4 textures double image bandwidth and the planner's
  tile parallelism has not been looked at

The strict bar (every view >= 98 % within 1 %) is not met on the large set. Looking at the
worst view (`docs/validation/monstree-full/worst_*.png`), the two maps are the same map;
differences are scattered speckle in low-texture regions with no tile or stripe structure,
which is the signature of different AliceVision versions (3.1 on the node vs 2026 dev tree)
and FMA/texture-filter precision, not of a broken kernel. To settle it properly the plan is a
same-version CUDA reference (build this AliceVision tree with CUDA on a NVIDIA box, or run the
CUDA backend of this exact tree on the node) - until then the numbers above are the honest
statement: identical validity masks, zero median error, ~1-8 % of pixels per view differing
by more than 1 %.

### monstree-mini6 on house-pc, RX 5500 XT (Linux), 2026-09-03

Same-machine CUDA reference (1080 Ti, 31.9 s) vs HIP on an RDNA1 card (60.7 s): masks
identical on all views, median error 0, 96-98 % within 1 %. HIP-vs-HIP across GPUs
(RX 5500 XT Linux vs RX 9070 Windows, identical build) shows the same spread, so ~2 % of
pixels differing by >1 % is the cross-GPU noise floor. Details and panels:
[docs/validation/monstree-mini6-rx5500xt-linux/index.md](validation/monstree-mini6-rx5500xt-linux/index.md).

### monstree-full (41 views) on house-pc, RX 5500 XT (Linux), 2026-09-03

447.7 s vs 105.5 s CUDA on the same host; masks identical on 41/41, median error 0, median
view 98.1 % within 1 % (worst 92.3 %). Same envelope as the RX 9070. Details:
[docs/validation/monstree-full-rx5500xt-linux/index.md](validation/monstree-full-rx5500xt-linux/index.md).

### house-pc, RX 6750 XT (RDNA2, Linux), 2026-09-03

6 views 31.0 s (CUDA 1080 Ti 31.9 s, same host), 41 views 226.1 s (105.5 s); masks identical
on every view, median error 0, 97.5 % / 98.1 % median-view within 1 %. The RX 6750 XT and the
RX 5500 XT produce identical statistics on both sets (RDNA1 and RDNA2 agree bit-for-bit, see
the compare in this session). Pages: [6 views](validation/monstree-mini6-rx6750xt-linux/index.md),
[41 views](validation/monstree-full-rx6750xt-linux/index.md).

## v0.2.0 regression (2026-09-04)

The bridge v2 work changed the allocator, the planner and the mip-level storage. Regression
against the v0.1.0 outputs (which this document validates against CUDA):

* 41 views, RX 9070, final native build, default settings: 123.0 s, depth maps bit-identical
  to the v0.1.0 output.
* 6 views: every configuration in the bridge matrices (`docs/validation/bridge-v2/`, 40+ runs
  across the RX 9070 and the RX 6750 XT, VRAM caps down to 500 MB, every class forced to
  system RAM) is bit-identical to the uncapped run.
* The strict per-view criterion (>= 98 % of jointly valid pixels within 1 %) is at the noise
  floor of the RX 6750 XT (97.5 % median view), so the matrix runner reports the number rather
  than PASS/FAIL against CUDA; bit-identity to the validated output is the regression gate.
