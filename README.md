# Cheshire

**Meshroom / AliceVision photogrammetry on AMD Radeon GPUs, via HIP.**

AliceVision's dense reconstruction (`DepthMap`, the stage Meshroom needs a GPU for) is
written in CUDA and has only ever run on NVIDIA. Cheshire compiles those same CUDA kernels as
HIP through a small compatibility layer, adds a **memory bridge** that lets the stage spill from
VRAM into system RAM instead of failing, and packages the result for Windows and Linux.
Validated against a CUDA node's output on RDNA1, RDNA2 and RDNA4 cards.

The cat that grins on any hardware.

## Results

Same photos, same SfM, same DepthMap parameters as the CUDA reference (Meshroom 2023.3 on a
GTX 1080 Ti); only the GPU stage differs. Metrics are per view over pixels valid in both maps.

| GPU | OS | 6 views | 41 views | valid masks | median rel. depth error | within 1 % (median view, 6 / 41) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GTX 1080 Ti (CUDA reference) | Linux | 31.9 s | 105.5 s | | | |
| Radeon RX 9070, RDNA4 | Windows | **17.4 s** | 124.4 s | identical | 0.0000 | 98.9 % / 98.7 % |
| Radeon RX 6750 XT, RDNA2 | Linux | **31.0 s** | 226.1 s | identical | 0.0000 | 97.5 % / 98.1 % |
| Radeon RX 5500 XT, RDNA1 | Linux | 60.7 s | 447.7 s | identical | 0.0000 | 97.5 % / 98.1 % |

RDNA1 and RDNA2 produce bit-identical depth maps. The remaining 1-3 % of pixels that differ by
more than 1 % between GPU generations (and against CUDA) is the algorithm's cross-hardware
noise floor: texture-filter and FMA rounding, not a port defect. Full per-view tables and
side-by-side panels: [docs/validation](docs/validation/).

## Memory bridge

Measured on the RX 9070 (`hip/tests/membridge_probe.hip`), the tiers the bridge chooses between:

| memory | kernel streaming read |
|---|---|
| VRAM (`hipMalloc`) | 585-619 GB/s |
| mapped system RAM (`hipHostMalloc`, PCIe 4.0 x16) | 24.6-26.6 GB/s |
| `hipMallocManaged` | 26.6 GB/s (no page migration on Windows) |
| pinned host copies | 28 GB/s each way |

On Windows the driver already lets `hipMalloc` run past VRAM into system RAM; on Linux it fails
hard. The bridge (`hip/compat/include/cheshire/bridge.h`) makes both behave the same, and v2
decides *what* spills by buffer class instead of by arrival order. Measured, one class at a
time behind PCIe, every run bit-identical:

| spilled to system RAM (6 views) | fine-grained host memory | coarse-grained (shipped) |
|---|---|---|
| nothing | 20.6 s | 20.2 s |
| depth/sim maps (879 MB) | 35.9 s (1.7x) | 25.5 s (1.3x) |
| similarity volumes (6.0 GB) | 96.4 s (4.7x) | 76.6 s (3.8x) |
| camera images (186 MB) | 460 s (22x) | 20.4 s (1.0x) |

The host tier is coarse-grained (`hipHostMallocNonCoherent`): the GPU caches it, atomics work,
and the texture-sampled camera images stop costing anything. Images stay resident regardless
(the planner reserves VRAM for them), volumes and maps spill, and the DepthMap planner sizes
its tile parallelism from the bridge's budget instead of `hipMemGetInfo`:

| VRAM available | v1 (arrival order, planner unaware) | v2 |
|---|---|---|
| 1.5 GB | 47.7 s, 188 spills | 20.0 s, 0 spills |
| 1 GB | | 20.3 s, 0 spills |
| 500 MB (below one tile) | fails upstream | 47.2 s, runs |

Tile parallelism costs nothing to give up on this GPU, so a card with 1 GB to spare runs the
stage at full speed. Design, knobs and every table:
[docs/02-memory-bridge.md](docs/02-memory-bridge.md).

## What was found on the way (reproducers in `hip/tests/`)

* **HIP drops `surf2Dwrite` stores into 16-bit float arrays**, on Windows and Linux alike;
  reads are fine. AliceVision's mip chain is built through a buffer copy instead.
* **Linux ROCm 7.2 has no `hipMallocMipmappedArray`** on RDNA1 (and WSL2 has no textures at
  all). Mipmaps are emulated in the compat layer as one texture per level, in array or pitched
  linear memory: bit-identical to native mipmaps on the RX 9070, 15 % slower there, so the
  Windows build keeps native. Linear levels are what lets the bridge account for camera images.
* **GPU atomics into mapped host memory are silently wrong on Linux** unless the memory is
  allocated non-coherent: on an RX 6750 XT, `atomicMin` into default (fine-grained) host memory
  fails on every element while `atomicAdd` works, and both are right on
  `hipHostMallocNonCoherent` memory (`hip/tests/host_atomics.hip`; Windows passes all cases).
  Anything that spills a buffer kernels do atomics on, LLM runtimes included, needs to know.
* **Fine-grained host memory is the wrong tier for texture-sampled data**: with the default
  mapping, 186 MB of camera images behind PCIe cost 22x while 6 GB of streamed volumes cost
  4.7x; allocated coarse-grained, the device caches them and the images cost nothing.
* **ROCm for Windows installs as pip wheels**, no admin installer. CMake refuses to mix
  `cl.exe` with clang for HIP: use `clang-cl` for both. `-fgpu-rdc` is broken on Windows, so
  the device code is compiled as one unity translation unit.
* **A relocatable bundle needs things the dependency walkers never see**: HIP loads the
  code-object manager (`libamd_comgr` / `amd_comgr0702.dll`) at runtime on both OSes, and
  without it the GPU simply "does not exist". On Linux a WSL build box also ships the
  `/dev/dxg` flavour of `libhsa-runtime64`, which must be swapped for the KFD one. With those
  in place RDNA1 works natively on ROCm 7.2.

## Downloads

Binaries are on the [v0.2.0 release](https://github.com/dspl1236/cheshire/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
(bridge v2); the data sets and references are on
[v0.1.0](https://github.com/dspl1236/cheshire/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and unchanged, the depth
maps being bit-identical between the two:

| asset | size | contents |
|---|---|---|
| `cheshire-alicevision-hip-windows-x64-rocm7.2.1-gfx1201.zip` (v0.2.0) | 100 MB | self-contained AliceVision + HIP DepthMap for RDNA4 on Windows; unzip, needs only the Adrenalin driver |
| `cheshire-alicevision-hip-windows-x64-rocm7.2.1-rdna3-rdna4.zip` (v0.2.0) | ~110 MB | the same, with code objects for gfx1100/1101/1102/1200/1201: RX 7000 owners, this is the one to try |
| `cheshire-alicevision-hip-linux-x64-rocm7.2.tar.gz` (v0.2.0) | 116 MB | relocatable Linux bundle, code objects for RDNA1-RDNA4; needs only `amdgpu` + `/dev/kfd` |
| `monstree-mini6-meshroom-cache.tar.gz` (v0.1.0) | 383 MB | 6-view Meshroom 2023.3 cache: CameraInit, SfM, PrepareDenseScene and the CUDA DepthMap reference |
| `monstree-full-cuda-reference.tar.gz` (v0.1.0) | 680 MB | 41-view SfM + CUDA DepthMap reference (GTX 1080 Ti) |
| `cheshire-hip-depthmap-outputs.tar.gz` (v0.1.0) | 966 MB | the HIP depth maps behind the table above (RX 9070 6 + 41 views, RX 5500 XT, RX 6750 XT) |

Reproduce a row: unpack a cache under `data/ref/<dataset>/`, then `scripts\run-depthmap.cmd <dataset>`
(Windows, set `CHESHIRE_INSTALL` to the unzipped folder) or `scripts/linux/run-depthmap.sh` (Linux).
Both run the exact Meshroom 2023.3 DepthMap command line and finish with `scripts/compare_depthmaps.py`,
which prints the per-view table and writes the side-by-side panels. Photos are
[alicevision/dataset_monstree](https://github.com/alicevision/dataset_monstree).

## Help wanted: RDNA3

Every package carries RDNA3 code objects (gfx1100/1101/1102) and none has run on RDNA3
hardware; there is no such card here. Ten minutes on an RX 7600/7700/7800/7900 closes the gap:

1. Download the RDNA3+RDNA4 Windows zip (or the Linux bundle) and
   `monstree-mini6-meshroom-cache.tar.gz` from the release pages above.
2. Unpack the cache under `data/ref/monstree-mini6/`, unzip the package anywhere, then
   `set CHESHIRE_INSTALL=<unzipped folder>` and `scripts\run-depthmap.cmd monstree-mini6`
   (Linux: `scripts/linux/run-depthmap.sh <bundle> <cache> <out> <cache>/DepthMap/<id>`).
3. It prints the card name, `Task done in (s)`, and a per-view table against the CUDA
   reference; `compare_stats.md` lands next to the depth maps. Open an issue with those two
   things and the card model. A `[cheshire] bridge summary` line appears with
   `CHESHIRE_BRIDGE_LOG=1` if anything spilled.

Expected: mask agreement 1.000, median relative depth error 0.0000, 97-99 % of pixels within
1 % on every view, and a time somewhere between the RX 6750 XT and the RX 9070 rows.

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `hip/compat/include/cheshire/` | the CUDA -> HIP compatibility header, the memory bridge, the mipmap emulation |
| `hip/port/` | fused SGM aggregation and the other upstreamable source changes, applied by `scripts/apply_hip_patch.py` |
| `hip/tests/` | standalone HIP probes: textures, surfaces, mipmaps, bandwidth, allocation, launch overhead, the bridge |
| `scripts/` | Windows build (`build-alicevision.cmd`), Linux superbuild and bundle (`scripts/linux/`), validation runner, comparison tool |
| `docs/` | findings, toolchain notes, bridge design, port log, validation, performance, Linux build |
| `third_party/aliceVision` | upstream AliceVision, pinned as a submodule and left untouched; the HIP backend is a patch set |

## Building

* Windows (RDNA3/RDNA4): [docs/01-toolchain-windows.md](docs/01-toolchain-windows.md), then
  `scripts\build-alicevision.cmd gfx1201 install`.
* Linux (RDNA1-RDNA4): [docs/06-linux-build.md](docs/06-linux-build.md), then
  `scripts/linux/build-deps.sh` and `scripts/linux/build-alicevision.sh bundle`.
* Validate: `scripts\run-depthmap.cmd <dataset>` or `scripts/linux/run-depthmap.sh` against a
  Meshroom cache; `scripts/compare_depthmaps.py` produces the numbers and panels.

## Status and next

Works end to end on RDNA1, RDNA2 and RDNA4; RDNA3 has its code object in every bundle but no
hardware run yet. A production Meshroom 2023.3 node runs its DepthMap on the HIP build through
`scripts/linux/meshroom-pair.sh` (one wrapper, picks CUDA or HIP per run, so the card can be
swapped). Next: planner-chosen tile sizes for the below-one-tile regime, a same-version CUDA
reference, RDNA3 hardware.
